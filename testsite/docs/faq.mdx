<summary>Why do I get `Loading ...` using `JSONSchemaViewer` ?</summary>

Several reasons, most likely :

1. You have an error not related to `docusaurus-json-schema-plugin` in your codebase like [this one](https://github.com/jy95/docusaurus-json-schema-plugin/issues/17) : missing language(s) in prism config / ...
2. You broke the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) or one of your dependancies did
3. You have more than [one copy of React in the same app](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html) or mismatching versions of React and React DOM

If none of these helped you, consider to have a reproducible example before asking help to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/community/support) / [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991)

<details>
<summary>Why the minimal JSON Schema version is Draft-07 ?</summary>

Several reasons :
- Many actors (like [ajv](https://ajv.js.org/guide/schema-language.html#draft-07-and-draft-06) ) acknowledge that it is most widely used version of JSON Schema specification
- Many tools don't care anymore for older versions such as Draft-04
- It fits my needs when I designed this project

:::tip

You can migrate schemas from draft-04 to draft-07 using [ajv-cli](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-cli#migrate-schemas)
