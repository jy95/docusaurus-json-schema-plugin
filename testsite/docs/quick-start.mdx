> Getting started with `docusaurus-json-schema-plugin`

Install `docusaurus-json-schema-plugin` using your desired package manager :

```bash npm2yarn
npm install docusaurus-json-schema-plugin
```

:::tip NPM only

When installing with npm, add this to the previous command : `--prefer-dedupe`

```bash
npm install docusaurus-json-schema-plugin --prefer-dedupe
```

Why `--prefer-dedupe` ? Because of [Invalid Hook Call Warning](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html) common issue in projets

:::

Provide a JSON Schema **the way you want** - for example as a static asset :
```jsx title="/static/schemas/mySuperSchema.json"
{
   "type":"array",
   "description":"Represent a street address such as ['1600','Pennsylvania','Avenue','NW']",
   "items":false,
   "prefixItems":[
      {
         "type":"number",
         "description":"The address number"
      },
      {
         "type":"string",
         "description":"The name of the street"
      },
      {
         "enum":[
            "Street",
            "Avenue",
            "Boulevard"
         ],
         "description":"The type of street"
      },
      {
         "enum":[
            "NW",
            "NE",
            "SW",
            "SE"
         ],
         "description":"The city quadrant of the address"
      }
   ]
}
```
